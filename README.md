# Effect of Elevation on Alruistic Behaviour 

*Project done as part of the "Intro to Psychology" course at IIIT-H during Monsoon 2020.*
- For a detailed report please refer to "Final Psychology Presentation.pdf" in the repository.

## Hypothesis

- We expect there to be a marked change in the participantsâ€™ altruism levels depending on the video that they have been shown. 
- We believe that witnessing a virtuous/prosocial act leads individuals to be more likely to perform the prosocial act themselves.
- A positive correlation is to be expected between  the altruism levels shown by the participants and the video they have been shown.

## Results & Observations from data collected

### Results on the self-rating variables
- We find that optimistic about humanity, happy, arousal and pleasantness exhibit means in a decreasing order when going from elevation, control and sad videos. 
- However, we find that the means of wanting to help others, uplifted, warm feeling in the chest  and wanting to become a better person are highest in the sad video which is not in accordance with our hypothesis.

### Results based on whether or not personal things are at stake
- We can observe that there is a high correlation for seven measures of self-rating when personal interests are not at stake.
- However, only two measures of self-rating have a high correlation when personal interests are at stake.

### Division based on thought vs action
- We can observe that there is a high correlation for six measures of self-rating when in thought  based questions.
- However, only three measures of self-rating have a high correlation in the action based questions.
